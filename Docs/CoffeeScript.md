## Zephyros - CoffeeScript API

It's the same as using [the JavaScript API](JavaScript.md), with these extra steps:

* Enable the "Do something before launching" option in Preferences
* For this option's "bash command", put "coffee --compile ~/path/to/myfile.js"
* Optionally, add '~/path/to/myfile.js'
* Then just run your new .coffee file per the JS API's instructions
